ACE2 protein:
the alignment score of human and mouse is:3579
the alignment score of cat and mouse is:3592
the alignment score of human and cat is:3717
the percentage identity between human and mouse is:82.11%
the percentage identity between cat and mouse is:81.74%
the percentage identity between human and cat is:85.22%
The human and cat ACE2 protein sequences are the most similar.During the evolution, the divergence of human and mouse ACE2 proteins is prior to the divergence of human and cat ACE2 proteins.So the difference of ACE2 protein between human and mouse is higher than human and cat.
